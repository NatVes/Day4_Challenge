# Code Refactor Challenge

---

## Description

This project focuses on the vital task of improving web accessibility for a marketing agency's website. Accessibility is a crucial aspect of web development, ensuring that the site is usable for individuals with disabilities. The primary goal is to enhance the existing codebase to meet specific accessibility standards, which not only benefits users with disabilities but also improves the website's search engine optimization.

## Key Changes

**Semantic HTML Elements:**

The codebase has been refactored to incorporate semantic HTML elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>` etc. This ensures a more meaningful and structured representation of content, making it accessible for users relying on assistive technologies.

**Logical HTML Structure:**

The HTML elements have been organized to follow a logical structure, independent of styling and positioning. This improves the overall readability of the code and enhances the user experience for those using screen readers.

**Accessible Image and Icon Elements:**

All image and icon elements now contain descriptive and accessible `alt` attributes. This provides meaningful information for users who may not be able to view the images, fostering a more inclusive browsing experience.

**Sequential Heading Attributes:**

Heading attributes have been adjusted to fall in sequential order. This not only adheres to accessibility standards but also improves the document outline, making it more navigable for users relying on screen readers.

**Concise Title Element:**

Title element now contain concise and descriptive title. This not only helps users understand the content of the page but also contributes to better search engine optimization.

**CSS Efficiency:**

The CSS has been reworked for efficiency by consolidating selectors and properties. The stylesheets are now organized to follow the semantic structure of HTML elements, making it easier to maintain and understand.

**Comments for Clarity:**

Comments have been added before each element or section of the page in the CSS, providing clarity on the changes made. This makes the codebase more accessible for future developers and ensures long-term sustainability.
